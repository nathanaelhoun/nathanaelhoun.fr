Already interested in computer since when I was younger, my interest turned into a true passion when I was about 15 years old. I loved experimenting with motherboards, GPUs and others components. I also discovered programing and development on the Internet and in my studies, and I have spent a tremendous amount of time learning these things since 2018.

After graduated from the baccalauréat program (French High School Diploma) with honours, I decided to study in Computer Science. I chose the Cursus Master en Ingénierie, a french university curriculum at the Franche-Comté's University, where I am currently in my third year of the program. The CMI is an equivalent for the Master of Engineering Program.
